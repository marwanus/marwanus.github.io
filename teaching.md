### Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany
- **Teaching Assistant, Algebra and number theory**  
  *AG Komplexe Analysis, under the direction of Prof. Dr. Alexander Schmitt*  
  - Oct 2023 – Oct 2023
    - Substituted a colleague for a three classes. The course included the following concepts: Divisibility in rings (especially the ring of integers and polynomial rings); residual classes and congruences; Modules and ideals, Euclidean, principal ideal and factorial rings, the square reciprocity law, prime number testing and cryptography,the structure of abelian groups (or modules over PIDs), theorem on symmetric functions, field extensions, Galois correspondence, Constructions with compass and ruler, non-abelian groups (Lagrange's theorem, normal subgroup, solvability, Sylow groups).

- **Teaching Assistant, Cybersecurity**  
  *AG Mathematik und Informatik, under the direction of Dr. Aruni Choudhary*  
  - Mar 2023 – Sep 2023
     - Conducted exercise class for Cybersecurity module, including the following concepts: authentication mechanisms, security models (Access Control Matrix Model, the Take-Grant Protection Model, the Bell-LaPadula and related models, the Chinese Wall Model, the Lattice Model of Information Flow), capability based systems and hardware protection mechanism concepts (protection rings). The course included also  implementation vulnerabilities such as race conditions, stack and heap overflows, integer overflows, and return oriented programming.
     - Problems that arise when humans interface with security e.g., password habits and password entry mechanisms, human responses to security prompts, incentives and distractors for better security, or reverse Turing tests.

- **Teaching Assistant, Proseminar on "Proofs from THE BOOK"**  
  *AG Komplexe Analysis, under the direction of Prof. Dr. Alexander Schmitt*  
  - Oct 2022 – Mar 2023
    - Conducted a proseminar on "Proofs from THE BOOK", including the following concepts: basics of linear algebra, analysis, number theory and some elementary but ubiquitous concepts and reasoning from discrete mathematics. The goal for students is to understand some of the proofs that Paul Erdos calls "The Proofs from THE BOOK". These proofs are intended to be highly efficient, concise and beautiful in terms of technique and scope.
